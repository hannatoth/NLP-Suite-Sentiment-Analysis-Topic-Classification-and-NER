# NLP-Suite-Sentiment-Analysis-Topic-Classification-and-NER


This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts demonstrating various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis on Twitter data, topic classification, and named entity recognition. The project combines the use of cutting-edge NLP frameworks like BERT, NLTK, and spaCy.

## Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This section of the repository focuses on analyzing the sentiment of tweets, using Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to prepare, analyze, and visualize Twitter data.

- Twitter_Sentiment.ipynb: This notebook is the core of the sentiment analysis project. It demonstrates the process of loading the Twitter dataset, pre-processing the data, applying sentiment analysis models, and visualizing the results.  
- train_tweet.csv & test_tweets.csv: These CSV files contain the dataset used in the sentiment analysis. train_tweet.csv is used for training the sentiment models, while test_tweets.csv is used for validation and testing to evaluate the model performance.  
- twitter_sentiment.py: A Python script that provides an automated way to apply the sentiment analysis model to new tweet data. It includes functions for data loading, model application, and result output.  


## Exploratory Notebooks

These notebooks explore various other NLP tasks, using different datasets and NLP tools to provide insights into the capabilities and comparisons of different approaches.

- Topic-classification-BERT.ipynb: Demonstrates the application of the BERT model for topic classification, illustrating how deep learning can be utilized to understand and categorize text topics effectively.  
- NERC.ipynb: Focuses on Named Entity Recognition and Classification using both traditional and modern NLP techniques, showing how entities in text can be identified and classified.  
- NLTK_SPACY_comparison.ipynb: Compares the performance and utility of two popular NLP libraries, NLTK and spaCy, in processing and analyzing text.  
- Sentimen.ipynb: Further experiments with sentiment analysis, exploring different models and methodologies to refine and enhance sentiment detection.
